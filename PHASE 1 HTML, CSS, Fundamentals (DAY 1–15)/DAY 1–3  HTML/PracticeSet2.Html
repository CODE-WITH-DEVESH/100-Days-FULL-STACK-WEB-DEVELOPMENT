<h1>Akshay Kumar</h1> 
<hr>
<p>Akshay Hari Om Bhatia[1] (born Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia; 9 September 1967[2]), known professionally as Akshay Kumar (pronounced [əkˈʂəj kʊˈmaːɾ]), is an Indian actor and film producer working in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema"> Hindi cinema. </a> Referred to in the media as "Khiladi Kumar",[3][4] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has won several awards, including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards. He received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020.[7][8] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on both lists.[9][10][11] In 2021, Kumar was awarded the highest tax payer "Sanman Patra" for consecutively paying the highest tax as an individual for the past five years.[12]</p>

<p>Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi. The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the Khiladi film series, in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005).</p>

<p>While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response to several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015), Airlift (2016), and Jolly LLB 2 (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with Kesari, Mission Mangal, Housefull 4, Good Newwz, and the 2021 action film Sooryavanshi. All of Kumar's subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of the comedy-drama OMG 2 (2023).[13] </p>
